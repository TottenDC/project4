TechDegree Unit 4 Project - Game Design with OOJS

Purpose:
-Practice object-oriented programming with JavaScript
-Build an awesome "hang man"-like game where players use an on-screen keyboard to guess a phrase

Note:
-Original CSS file and HTML curtesy of Treehouse.
-I only added script tags to link JavaScript pages to the HTML.
-I created all JavaScript files and code.

Goals:
-Create two classes: Phrase and Game
  -Phrase contains all methods and properties related to direct manipulation of a selected phrase
  -Game contains all methods and properties related to game state and logic
-Create app.js to link DOM and objects
-Utilize standardized code commenting
